              Peak is the Decision Intelligence company. Decision Intelligence
              is the commercial application of AI to drive real business
              outcomes. As we’re now in the intelligence era, businesses need to
              do more than simply making a slightly better decision in one small
              area of a business. It’s about making great decisions, everywhere,
              all the time. We work with leading brands such as
              PrettyLittleThing, Nike, KFC and Footasylum. If you want to be in
              the same room as companies like this and network with world-class
              data scientists and engineers, then book your ticket to AltitudeX.
