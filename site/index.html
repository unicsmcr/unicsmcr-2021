              <p>
                  UniCS is the University of Manchester's tech society. We are a big
                  community with a passion for technology and creating innovative
                  solutions for everyone to enjoy. Through our hackathons and other
                  events, we aim to bring students and industry closer together. When we
                  aren’t organising our own events we also travel to events in places
                  like Barcelona, Helsinki, and Bordeaux, amongst other exotic
                  destinations, often free due to various hackathon sponsors. Come join
                  us to see what we get up to this year!
